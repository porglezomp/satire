Amazon² Rainforest Prime
=========================

This is the source code of our Humanities Literature satire project.
It's a satire of the Silicon Valley path to solving problems by throwing tech at it without considering any social context.
We specifically consider internet.org's sometimes questionable methods and obnoxious site design.

Within, we describe the Amazon² Rainforest Prime initiative, a charity to bring free two-day shipping to every inhabitant of the Amazon Rainforest.

This project is a work of parody and is not actually associated with Amazon.
Seriously, this isn't that hard.
