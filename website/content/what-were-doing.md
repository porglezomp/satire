What We're Doing
================
!Parody of the altruistic language that Facebook uses in Internet.org
We've thought long and hard about how to do our charitable giving; we've fought to find a place where we can make a real difference, and we've found it.

!More Ingenue Narrator to discredit the message that they're trying to convey.
The Amazon is almost completely unaccessable. The native people of the region haven't had any exposure to modern, civilized society. 
Amazon is partnering with Internet.org to bring Amazon Prime to the Amazon. We're sending top-of-the-line desktop computers to the rainforest to bring them up to speed and up to date. 

Amazon's fleet of drones and extensive marketplace is already the envy of the world over. Why not bring the best of the internet to people who haven't even seen a computer before.
!The use of "eligible" is intentional, it's completely the wrong sentiment when using the altruistic tone that they do.
Anyone and everyone living anywhere in the Amazon is eligible for Rainforest Prime, offering products they couldn't have dreamed about before today.

We're excited to get started on this initiative. We hope you are too:
