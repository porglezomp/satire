The Computers

With Rainforest Prime we're not just bringing Rainforest Prime to the people of the Amazon. We're building communities. 

With the latest hardware and specs to rival any other PC at that price point, the power of the Dell Inspiron won't just bring the people of the Amazon into the 21st century: it'll make them competitive in the 2016 economy.
Select monitors will be available at a discount on Rainforest Prime.

The Airdrop
-----------

NASA's Pathfinder mission did the ground work that allows us to deliver the Dell Inspirons to the heart of the Amazon. While landing on the surface of another planet, they faced many of the same problems that we will. Their elegant system ideally allows us to deliver the computers to the forest floor with pinpoint accuracy.

Composed of 7 sheets of an ultra-tough material called "Vectran", the balloons allow for a puncture-proof material that can withstand anything-even being dropped through the canopy of the Amazon.

Watch the latest test NASA did with us.

With a 400 million  dollar test payload, we're reasonably sure the computers will land safely.

The Drones
----------

Using the most cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we've extended the Amazon Prime Air drone software to allow them to navigate where humans can barely walk 10 feet without being eaten by a kapok.
! A kapok is a tree.
