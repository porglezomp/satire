!This page is a parody of the way that Amazon products are written. It's written from the perspective of an Ingenue Narrator, that doesn't realize how colonial the language he's using is.

!Uses the ludicrous to make the proposition even more absurd. Technically the solution works, but in practice that's completely ridiculous.
