The Satire
==========

This site was created for the [Pioneer Humanities class][humanities] satire project by Owen Hughes and Caleb Jones.

Legal
-----

This site is a work of parody, and is not affiliated with Amazon.
No insult is specifically directed at Amazon, the wordplay was simply too convenient.

The Target
----------

This site is inspired by the Silicon Valley practice of throwing technology at a problem without considering the social impacts of their technologies.
Many of these initiatives have unintended consequences, or simply don't actually address the problem that exist.
In developing our fantastical charity, we sought to fail in these ways as completely as we could.

It also parodies charities that exist primarily to create new customers for their sponsor company.
In this case, Rainforest Prime doesn't actually provide any substantive free services, they provide a market for natives to buy expensive luxury goods from Amazon.

We target the sort of racist, colonial, stereotyping charities that develop when you have a lot of white men trying to think what they can do, without understanding the people they're interacting with.
Some of the specifics of this site were inspired by the old state of internet.org, which was racist and classist, and often ended up confining poor people to a subset of the internet that didn't really empower them.

It's worth noting that internet.org appears to be improving on their previous mistakes, and making a charity that actually provides higher quality service, and is making progress in net neutrality.
They still have their problems, though.

The Tactics
-----------

We parody the actual design of many trendy single page site designs.
Most significantly, we impede navigation with animations that prevent any interaction until they complete.
We have lots of pictures that don't actually add any information to the content surrounding them, but do provide more opportunities to navigate.
Putting all the content on a single page with no full page loading is very trendy, and is also overkill.

In addition, the professionalism of the navigation and animation lends more credibility to the content of the satire, which makes all of the absurdities that much more absurd.

The concept is a burlesque of internet.org.
It exaggerates all of the worst parts of the site in an effort to make them more obvious, and to showcase just how problematic they really are.
Our Myths and Facts is one of the strongest examples of this. 

We make substantial use of dramatic irony through a na√Øf narrator.
The work is written from the perpsective of someone with definite drive, definite passion, but they can't see the grander picture.
This comes up very frequently in the promo video.

We also use some clever word play, double entendres, euphemisms, and puns.
This is interspersed throughout.
