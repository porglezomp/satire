Full script:
Hi, hello. 
I’ve been looking forward to this moment since the moment we started this project, three weeks ago. 
This planet has a problem. 
There is poverty everywhere. Half the world has never seen a computer, let alone browsed the web. 
What’s the first thing that come to mind when you think of underdeveloped countries? African nations and india, both of which are easily accessible. Planes can fly to and from the countries. They may not have adequate drinking water; they may not have indoor plumbing; other charities are taking care of those countries. At amazon, we pride ourselves on our unending creativity.
We’ve thought long and hard about it, and I’m here today to announce what the new charity we’re staring is all about.
At amazon, we have a unique set of technologies (and brand name) that make us solely qualified to serve a certain community. 
Today we are extraordinarily excited to announce our plans to bring free Amazon Prime service to every last corner of the Amazon Rainforest.
