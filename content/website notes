Satire of flat design, use a couple of colors and excessively layer out the things
Main menu as generic as possible
Random pictures of Amazon people doing unrelated things

Competition to start the biggest amazon store
Get bought out by amazon

Cover product range, patently absurd things
	Some things that they do need
	Focus on amazon prime stuff,
